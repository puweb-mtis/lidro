                As a corportion identity that represents LIDRO, it is a compound word that combines LI of LiDAR and dro of droid (robot).
                LIDRO's CI was intended to be expressed as simply as possible, and by expressing a part of the alphabet DR of the droid open,
                the base on which the droid can operate The circuit board was shaped, and we wanted to express a mind that was always open to learn and apply new technologies. The shape of O among the CIs was shaped and expressed as if the LiDAR sensor was scanning the entire 360-degree direction based on the center.

                We established the identity of LIDRO Co., Ltd. by shaping the wavelength of light that measures objects around the LiDAR sensor.
                The end of the wave is placed diagonally to emphasize the dynamics, and it implies the meaning of continuously spreading the wave and the meaning of continuous development.

                You can use the mixed symbol type by mixing the symbol form of LIDRO with the text.<br>
                The shape of O, which embodies a LiDAR sensor, is expressed by mixing with text, and the shape of the mixed symbol is as follows.
